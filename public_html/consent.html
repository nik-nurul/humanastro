			Researchers and project team members:
				- Dr Chris Fluke, Project Owner: Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology.
				- Vivien Farrel, Project Supervisor: Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology.
				- Danvers Flett, Team leader: Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology.
				- Michal Choi, Team Member: Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology.
				- Rhys Fallon, Team Member: Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology.
				- Nik Fakhirah, Team Member: Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology.
				- Syabil Shamsul, Team Member: Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology.

			Project and researcher interests:
				- There are no confilcts of interest for the research team to declare.

			What is this study about?
				- The human visual system is regularly proposed as the Gold standard for novel visual discovery in  astronomy, but with limited research to support the claim. As data collection volume grows, so does our dependance on Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning. So much so, technology is expected to make discoveries for astronomers. 
				With this in mind, this study attempts to answer the question "Are machines better than humans (at astronomy)?"

			Why am i being invited to participate?
				- You have been invited to particpate in this project because as an astronomer you have first-hand experience in astronomical discovery and we are interested to see how your experience and studies performs against the current standard of of technology in novel discovery.

			What's involved if i take part?
				- If you decide to participate, you will undertake several online timed tests on your personal computer. These tests are composed of several sequentially displayed images in which you must analyse and discover certain traits within the image. This will be done by an eye and cursor tracking program that records where you are looking and and pointing your cursor.
				With your permission, we would like to record the results of where you were looking and pointing in the form of heatmaps and whether or not you succesfully discovered the specific items. Any video or audio of you undertaking the test will not be recorded.
				You will be given the opportunity to leave feedback at all stages of the process.

			Possible benefits and risks of participating
				- We will not be asking for any personally identifying information, instead only recording, with your consent, non identifying audience demogrophic information. Your participation in this project will help the Astronomy industry better understand the usefulness of Artifiicial Intelligence and Machine Learning and create a more efficient process of scientific discovery.
				While we do not anticipate there is any risk of causing you distress, if there is at any point you do no wish to continue, you retain the right to do so.
				This test may display a flash of images thus participants with epilepsy should take precaution.

			Free consent and withdrawal from particiation
			- Participation in this research project is voluntary and wwill not affect your relationship with swinburne university in any way. If you consent to participate in this project will ask you to click yes at the bottom of this page. You have the right to withdraw your participation at any time without question or explanation.

			Confidentiality of your information
			- You are invited to particpate by the project owwner, who has your contact details because...... The demographic information you provide is confidential and will only be used as described for the research project.

			Your privacy as a participant
			- Demographic information that may be recorded about you is:
				- Age range.
				- Gender.
				- Career Stage.
				Broad area of Astronomy.
			- A user ID may be assigned to your session to ensure you may quit and return to the test at any time, there will be no ID linking to you personally.
			- The results of the test will not be personally identifiable to any individual.

			Storage of your information
			- The information arising from this research will be securely stored indefinitely and may be used in future research by the research team. Digital records from this research project will be kept in secure computer folders that only the research team will access.
			The research team will not publish information arising from this research that identifies you (including any video recording you were part of) without your consent to do that.  

			What will be done with the information I provide through participating in the research?
			-......

			I acknowledge that:
				(a)	my participation is voluntary and that I am free to withdraw from the project at any time without explanation;
				(b)	the Swinburne project is for the purpose of research and not for profit;
				(c)	any identifiable information about me which is gathered during and as the result of my participating in this project will be: (i) collected and retained for the purpose of this project and (ii) accessed and analysed by the researcher(s) for the purpose of conducting this project;
				(d)	I will not be identified in publications or otherwise.
